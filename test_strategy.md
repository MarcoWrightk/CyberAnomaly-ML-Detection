This document outlines the testing methodology for the CyberAnomaly-ML-Detection system. The goal is to ensure reliability, performance, and security across all modules in real-time environments.

---

##  Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests
Validate individual functions and components.
- Framework: Pytest
- Coverage: Preprocessing, detection models, evaluation metrics, response logic

### 2. Integration Tests
Ensure modules interact correctly across the pipeline.
- Kafka → Preprocessing → Detection → Response
- LLM summary evaluation → Feedback generation

### 3. Performance Tests
Measure system throughput and latency under load.
- Tool: Apache JMeter
- Metrics: Requests/sec, latency, memory usage
- Scenarios: High-speed data ingestion, burst anomaly detection

### 4. Fuzzing & Adversarial Testing
Simulate malformed or malicious inputs.
- Goal: Validate system resilience and error handling
- Targets: Preprocessing, model inputs, response triggers

### 5. Security Validation
Test for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
- Tool: Nessus
- Scope: Container security, network exposure, dependency risks

##  Special Testing Modules

### `test_mcrmse.py`
- Validates the accuracy of summary evaluation using MCRMSE
- Compares analyst-written summaries against reference abstracts

### `test_rl_agent.py`
- Simulates evolving threat environments
- Evaluates agent adaptability and learning efficiency

### `test_shap_analysis.py`
- Ensures interpretability of model decisions
- Verifies SHAP values align with expected feature importance

---

##  Reporting & CI Integration

- All tests are integrated into Jenkins CI/CD pipeline
- Results are logged and visualized via Prometheus and Zabbix
- Failures trigger alerts and rollback mechanisms

---

##  Ethical Considerations

- Fuzzing and adversarial tests are sandboxed
- No real-world systems are targeted
- All simulations follow responsible disclosure principles
