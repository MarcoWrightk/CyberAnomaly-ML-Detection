# Technical Overview

##  Project Summary
This system is designed to detect cybersecurity anomalies in real-time using advanced machine learning techniques, deep learning architectures, and automated summary evaluation via large language models (LLMs). It is optimized for high-throughput, low-latency environments and includes automated response capabilities.

##  Core Components

###  Data Ingestion
- Real-time streaming via Apache Kafka and Apache Flink
- Storage integration with Apache Cassandra and Amazon DynamoDB
- Load balancing through Azure and AWS ELB

###  Preprocessing
- Feature engineering: normalization, encoding, compression
- Dimensionality reduction: PCA, LDA
- Drift detection and correction

###  Anomaly Detection
- Deep learning models: Variational Autoencoders (VAE), GANs
- Classical models: Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
- Reinforcement learning agents for adaptive threat detection

###  Evaluation
- Metrics: F1 Score, Recall, ROC-AUC, Latency, Data Drift
- SHAP for model interpretability
- MCRMSE for summary evaluation

###  Summary Evaluation Module
- Uses LLMs to assess incident summaries written by analysts
- Evaluates clarity, accuracy, and completeness
- Feedback loop for analyst improvement

###  Automated Response System
- Real-time corrective actions based on anomaly classification
- Configurator module for dynamic system adaptation
- Pyramid + Attention architecture for multi-scale decision-making

##  Testing & Validation
- Pytest for unit testing
- Apache JMeter for performance benchmarking
- Nessus for vulnerability simulation
- Real-world use cases: Chrome vulnerability detection, Amazon Pay protection

##  Deployment
- Containerized via Docker
- CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins
- Monitoring via Prometheus, Zabbix, and Azure dashboards

##  Legal & Ethical Considerations
- Jurisdiction-aware deployment strategies
- Responsible disclosure protocols
- Ethical reflection on automation and human oversight
